# Kafka playground

The aim of this repository is to compile notes and utilities for hands-on
exploration of [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

Folder [`kafka/`](kafka/) includes the configuration to start a Kafka cluster
locally using Docker Compose.
This code takes inspiration from Ruan Bekker's work available at
[ruanbekker/quick-starts](https://github.com/ruanbekker/quick-starts) (last
